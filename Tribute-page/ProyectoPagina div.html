            <P>I want to start by saying this. With this essay I don’t wanna to say that men are not worried about
                how they look, and much less that they don’t discrimination about their bodies. I want to show that
                society puts different stereotypes for men and women (gender stereotypes), and this stereotypes are
                affecting also men, but, not in the same way that affect women, and that causes that in the majority
                in the cases women are the ones that are more worried about beauty standard, but this doesn't have
                to do with the fact that also men are discriminated against and can go through problems for it. With
                that said, let’s start.
            </P>
            <h3><em>"The virtue of women is to be beautiful; that of men, to be noble.”
                    Immanuel Kant a German philosopher </em></h3> <br>
            <img src="ensayopagina.jpg" alt="A Cattle Auction" class="full-img">
            <br>
            <p>


                “The virtue of women is to be beautiful”. Over time we have heard things like “Women have to be
                pretty” “She is very pretty, she will be very lucky in life” “She looks like a princess” “She is
                very beautiful, she will have no problem finding a man”. People have associated beauty with women.
                Over the pass of the years society have put in women and men certain characteristics like:<br><br>

                <strong>men=intelligence</strong><br>
                <strong>women=beauty</strong><br><br>

                In the phrase Kant refers to beauty as the only thing a woman can achieve, it is as if females have
                nothing to contribute but beauty to the world. And it was not only him, he represented what people
                thought in that time and still think about women; the only reach that exists for them is being
                pretty.<br><br>
                “So? I don’t see the problem, women are beautiful, is that wrong?”<br><br>

                ASPS (The American Society of Plastic Surgeons) reveals that 92% of all cosmetic procedures were
                made by women, with the remaining 8% going to men in 2018.<br><br>

                Instituto de Trastornos Alimentarios (Institute of Eating Disorders) said that 90% of the reported
                cases of eating disorders were women.<br><br>

                Beauty standards are the set of characteristics that a society conventionally considers to be
                beautiful or attractive, this depends on the country and culture.

                It’s not the fact that women are beautiful or not, it’s the fact that society has certain
                characteristics for women to say if she is attractive or not. The beauty standards are normally
                impossible for the majority of women to achieve, then they must go on to develop eating problems or
                submit to dangerous surgeries.<br><br>

                Why would women do that? The problem is that women don’t have a choice. You can view it from the
                point that being “pretty” for women is a necessity and a tool that they can use to be successful. In
                this world a woman who is pretty is successful in life. Since it is enough for females to be
                "pretty", which authorizes them to be silly, insubstantial and frivolous. While it is up to men to
                transmit intelligence, logic and strength.

                If your only job in this world is being pretty, and you don’t meet with this, what else is there for
                you?. Fit with these standards is an obligation for women. It’s not a coincidence that most of the
                plastic surgeries, or most of the cases of eating disorders are from women.

                Being associated with beauty is not something that women are always proud of, it’s not a gift or
                privilege, it's a burden they must live with all their lives, and for generations to come if we
                don’t do anything about it.<br><br>

                My purpose, to demonstrate and to raise awareness that beauty standards are more likely to affect
                women more than men. Awareness because this is not a competition of who recibe more. It's a way to
                make people aware of one of the things that women live with. I want to inform because this is not
                only causing insecurities in women, this is causing dangerous health issues . We need to know what
                it’s happening, and do something about it. <br><br>
                I will talk about different ways that you can easily see how women are the representation of beauty
                and how it is affecting.<br><br>

            <h3>Magazines</h3>

            There are different characteristics that society relates to female and male as we saw, in magazines we
            can see that. A magazine made a study about analysis of the aesthetic stereotypes of women in nine
            fashion and beauty mexican magazines, the results were as follows<br><br>

            “The most widely distributed fashion and beauty magazines use images of women on their covers. In 100%
            of cases, the image of women is used as an advertisement.”<br><br>

            100% of the cases were women. The magazine it’s not for women, it’s about fashion and beauty, if a man
            is interested he can read it. So, why would there be a woman on the cover? This is consistent with the
            fact that women are seen to be the reference point for beauty messages, and how society keeps
            reinforcing these gender stereotypes; a “men's magazine” would be very different in terms of
            content.<br>

            And this continues to explain why disorders associated with body image, such as eating disorders, remain
            overwhelmingly more prevalent in women than in men.<br>

            Another results that the investigation did was related to the beauty standards:<br><br>

            “In what proportion do the images of women used on the covers of these magazines correspond to the
            aesthetic model of thinness?

            98% of the photographs corresponded to thin or skinny women, so we can affirm that the prevailing
            aesthetic model on the covers is thinness.”<br><br>

            The connection between beauty/fashion and women is evident. But also we can see how the beauty industry
            makes certain characteristics to the idea of beauty, like being thin. If a beauty magazine shows a
            skinny woman on the cover, then it is evident that women would associate being skinny as being
            beautiful, and this is how beauty standards are made. Women try to achieve this goal because it is what
            society says is beautiful.<br>

            Instituto de Trastornos Alimentarios said that 90% of the reported cases of eating disorders were women.
            All women are different, and have a different type of body. Making only certain characteristics valid to
            be beautiful is impossible. The only thing that would happen is that all women would want to be this
            impossible canon and they will not be able to reach it, so they will go through a process of
            malnutrition to get it.<br><br>

            <h3>Beauty contests</h3>

            “A beauty contest is a competition in which young women are judged to decide which one is the most
            beautiful.” Collins Dictionary <br><br>

            And again, we can see the same sexist reminder, the women as representation of beauty. One of the
            requirements to participate in this contest is being a woman. Is the reinforcing reminder that the only
            achievement of women is being pretty. “But beauty pageants also rate women's intelligence.”<br>
            “Most pageants tend to focus on beauty, but there has been an increasing trend on attempting to judge
            women participants on talent and even intelligence. The problem is that “talent” is subjective (and
            limited to actions that can be performed on stage in front of an audience) and unless they’re given an
            IQ examination by a qualified psychologist, it’s hard to determine a woman’s intelligence by asking her
            to name the state capitol of Wisconsin.” Said a plastic surgery website. It is true, the fact that the
            contest said “we are assessing the intelligence of women” is because it's morally wrong to put women on
            stage and rate them based on how they look, but that's exactly what they do. They are not judging women
            on their talent or intelligence, it’s just looking for the most “beautiful women”.<br><br>

            And the question is why women should compete and be judged to decide which one is the most beautiful?
            What traits would these women have to have in order to consider that beauty would have been achieved?
            What were their parameters? the way they are judged does not matter, what matters is what is causing it.
            A study performed in 2005 found a high rate of eating and mental disorders in women who participated in
            beauty pageants as a child. Many psychological experts have found that beauty pageants can lead to a
            whole host of mental issues amongst participants.<br>

            And it’s not only on the participants but imagine how hard it would be for a young girl seeing these
            girls trying to prove to the world who is most beautiful, or for a grown woman seeing the women who won
            the competition.<br>

            Women on most of this contest are aesthetically operated, and people know that, but, does it matter?
            They won the contest, they are proving to society that they are acceptable beautiful, why wouldn't women
            want that? Is this not what society keeps saying all the time? 92% of all cosmetic procedures are made
            by women. These women often undergo painful and sometimes dangerous surgeries in an attempt to try and
            look like their reality show role models.<br><br>


            <h3>Constantly reminder in society</h3>

            We have talked about some examples of how beauty is more present in women, and how hard it will be for
            women to see this representation everyday. But even if the magazines, or these beauty pageants would no
            longer exist the problem will exist, because these representations are only what people think, and that
            is something you can erase so easily.<br><br>

            What is body shaming? There is not an exact definition, but according to ANAD (National Association of
            Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders) “Body shaming is known as the action or practice of
            expressing humiliation about another individual’s body shape or size; a form of bullying that can result
            in severe emotional trauma, especially at a young age. Body shaming is done by parents, siblings,
            friends, enemies, and schoolmates and is often portrayed in the media.” <br><br>

            Why is this important? Because this is and will be a constant reminder to women that they need to be
            worried about their looks. Body shaming can affect anyone, I’m not saying that men don’t get
            discrimination, but in situations that happen in social media we can see clearly how people (not only
            men) are more worried about women’s bodies/look than for example their career or goals.<br>

            Some examples of body shaming include a Fox News host saying that Kelly Clarkson should ‘stay off the
            deep-dish pizza for a while’. A cruel photo of a pregnant Kim Kardashian being likened to a whale went
            viral across social media sites and former Girls Aloud star Cheryl Cole has campaigned against body
            shaming after being subjected to cruel taunts about her slender frame. Or even the former president of
            USA Donald Trump has a reputation for making disparaging remarks about women and their appearance. It
            wasn't just during the election. Throughout much of his public life, Trump has expressed contempt for
            women based solely on their physical appearance.<br><br>

            Records of the Undersecretariat of Public Health, reveal that attention with mental health specialists
            for problems about body dissatisfaction in 2014 and 2018 increased. Being 84% of the cases of the female
            gender.<br>

            With all this we saw, do you think women will be at peace with how they look? Do you think they will not
            mind the fact that they hear daily on social networks, family, friends, classmates comments criticizing
            their body? We saw several examples on how society is so focused on women's bodies instead of other
            characteristics like intelligence, strongest, anything more than body and beauty. <br><br><br>


            I am a woman, and I want to say that because as the subject of this essay I can say it’s true. Do you
            not know how many times I hear things like "eat well, you want to be thin" "are you going to eat all
            that?" "you would look better with shorter clothes" "cover yourself a bit, you don't have the body for
            that" "eat more" "black makes you look thin" ”eat less” “look at her, she's so pretty, look at how her
            dress looks attached "
            I mean how do I know that black makes you look thinner, it’s not something I investigate for myself.
            It’s so exhausting to hear what you should or shouldn’t be. Sometimes I feel it is not my body anymore,
            It’s like I didn’t have control of it. It’s like women are in a cattle auction, people are looking at
            your body deciding if you are attractive or not, reviewing about it, and if you are not, feeling guilty
            for having that body that they do not like. <br><br>

            I wanted to keep my opinion to the end because it’s my opinion, yes, but we saw statistics and facts
            that confirm It’s not only what I feel as being a woman, it’s what the majority of females feel. This is
            not something that we can’t overlook. This is happening right now and with social media it is only
            getting worse. <br>
            Beauty standards are more likely to affect more women than men. I hope the point of this essay it’s
            clear. It is not an essay of who suffers the most, much less a competition. I want to create awareness
            to the people who read this and that they think for a moment in their surroundings, especially women,
            and maybe they will see things they did not see before.
